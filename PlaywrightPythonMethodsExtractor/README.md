# Playwright Python Method Extractor (AST-Only, Production-Grade)

A fast, deterministic, LLM-free **Playwright Python method extraction service** built using Python AST parsing.

Optimized for:
- Playwright Python automation scripts  
- Large enterprise Python codebases  
- Byte-perfect extraction (no code modification)  
- Static analysis, test intelligence, and test-case workflows  
- High-volume API processing with MongoDB logging  

The system extracts top-level functions, class methods, and nested methods, injects required execution context (global variables and constructor-initialized attributes), and returns a **single-column CSV** where each row contains one complete method block.

---

## Features

### 1. AST-Based Extraction (No LLMs)
- Byte-perfect slicing from the original source  
- No decorators included  
- Preserves indentation, spacing, and code style  
- Supports `def` and `async def`  
- Supports nested functions  

### 2. Context Injection (Playwright-Oriented)

The extractor injects:
- **Top-level global assignments** (constants, fixtures, selectors)
- **Constructor (`__init__`) assignments** for class-based methods

Example constructor:

```python
def __init__(self, page):
    self.page = page
    self.base_url = "https://example.com"
````

Injected above each class method:

```python
self.page = page
self.base_url = "https://example.com"

def open(self):
    self.page.goto(self.base_url)
```

Rules:

* Only assignments inside `__init__` are injected
* Injection preserves original formatting
* Injection is deterministic and AST-driven
* No reference-based guessing or mutation

This design is well-suited for **Playwright Page Object Models**.

---

### 3. Chunking System

Splits extracted output into safe chunks (default: **20,000 characters per chunk**) while **never splitting a method**.

This enables:

* Safe downstream LLM usage
* Embedding pipelines
* Parallel processing

---

### 4. CSV Output

Produces a single-column CSV with header:

```
Raw Method
```

Each row contains:

* Injected context (if any)
* Full method source code
* Original formatting preserved

Excel/CSV injection is safely mitigated.

---

### 5. REST API (FastAPI)

Endpoints:

```
GET  /health
POST /extract
```

Supports:

* File upload
* Raw code paste
* Streaming CSV downloads

---

### 6. MongoDB Logging

Stores:

* API audit logs
* Raw uploaded Playwright Python scripts

Logging is **best-effort** and never blocks extraction.

---

### 7. Production-Grade Architecture

Includes:

* Middleware-based auditing
* Strict validation layer
* Structured logging
* Environment-based configuration
* Async MongoDB (Motor)
* Docker-ready deployment

## AST Extraction Rules

### Extracted

* Top-level functions
* Class methods (excluding `__init__`)
* Nested functions
* Sync and async functions

### Ordering

* Preserved exactly as in the source file

### Byte-Perfect Guarantee

* Extraction begins exactly at `def` or `async def`
* No decorators included
* No formatting changes
* No normalization or rewriting

### Not Extracted

* Constructors (`__init__`)
* Decorators
* Comments outside method bodies

---

## Injection Logic (Context Preservation)

Injected before each extracted method:

1. Global variable assignments
2. `self.<attr> = ...` assignments from `__init__`

Characteristics:

* No runtime evaluation
* No dependency inference
* No code mutation
* Exact source-line injection

This ensures extracted methods remain **standalone and analyzable**.

{
  "filename": "login.py",
  "content": "...",
  "size": 3240,
  "timestamp": "2025-01-10T12:30:00Z"
}
```

### API Logs Collection (`api_logs`)

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-10T12:30:01Z",
  "ip": "127.0.0.1",
  "user_agent": "...",
  "file_name": "login.py",
  "method_count": 12,
  "chunk_count": 1,
  "status": 200,
  "duration_ms": 15.2
}
```

---

## Logging

All logs follow a structured format:

```
2025-01-10 11:00:00 | INFO | playwright_python_method_extractor | Extracted 12 methods
```

---

## Validation Rules

Validation ensures:

* Code begins with `def` or `async def`
* Decorators are excluded
* Methods are ordered by source line
* Injected context consists only of strings

On failure, a `ValidationError` is raised internally.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Method does not start with def or async def

Decorators exist in the source. Decorators are intentionally excluded from extraction.

### No methods extracted

Possible causes:

* Syntax errors in source code
* File contains only `__init__`
* Encoding issues

### CSV issues in Excel

Excel may interpret rows as formulas. The CSV writer safely escapes dangerous prefixes.

---

## FAQ

### Why AST instead of an LLM?

AST parsing is deterministic, reproducible, safe, and scalable for large Playwright codebases.

### Does it support async Playwright tests?

Yes. `async def` is fully supported.

### Does it modify source code?

No. Extraction is byte-perfect.

### Is method order preserved?

Yes. Guaranteed.
